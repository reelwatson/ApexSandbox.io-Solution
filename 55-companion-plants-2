If the first plant is onions, the second should be lettuce, carrots, or tomatoes
If the first plant is lettuce, then the second should be cucumbers or onions. 
If the first plant is cucumbers, the second should be lettuce. 
If the first plant is carrots, the second should be onions. 
If the first plant is tomatoes, the second should be onions. 
If none of the above match, the plants are not companions.
No plants means our condition is true: all plants are next to a companion plant 
if there are no plants.
